# Eat Da Burger!
**Eat Da Burger!** is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page under `ready to eat` -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page under `devoured burgers`. The app will store every burger in a database, whether it's devoured or not.

## Installation
* CD to project folder and run ```npm install```
* Then create a database called ```burgers_db``` via mysql shell or mysql GUI with this command ```CREATE DATABASE burgers_db;```
* Then on the project folder run ```node server.js```
* The app will be running on [LOCALHOST:3000](http://localhost:3000)
